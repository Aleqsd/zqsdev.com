        "quote": "Alexandre is a rare Pokemon type in the gaming industry: with his engineering knowledge and his passion for agile processes, he quickly became a natural glue and key product POC across our org, in particular when we launched our first version of the platform. Undoubtedly, he has been a pivotal and instrumental hire for Jam.gg, often commanding immediate respect among his peers. Would recommend adding him to your Eng or Product team in a heartbeat!",

        "quote": "I had the pleasure to work with Alex at Jam.gg (formerly known as Piepacker) for two years. I couldn't have asked for a better partner to tackle such a complicated project with. He always pushes the limit of what people think isn't possible, stays open to feedback, and strives to help the team do better. He has worn multiple hats, from leading the engineering team, managing, recruiting, to PMing various projects. Alex made technical problems easy for designers to understand and always advocated for users so we could build the best product instead of cutting corners. He led the team to set up structure and an inclusive culture as one of the first members of the company. Anyone would be lucky to have an opportunity to work and learn from him.",
